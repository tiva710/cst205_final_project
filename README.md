# Soccerdle: Multimedia Design and Programming Final Project 

## Overview: 

Welcome to **Soccerdle**, a Wordle-like interactive web application designed to challenge and entertain soccer enthusiasts and their favorite players! This game combines soccer knowledge, intuitive gameplay, and gamified hints to create a fun, educational, and engaging experience. 

This project is a culmination of the efforts of Team 11492 for **CST 205: Multimedia Design and Programming** at **California State University, Monterey Bay**. It showcases our skills in Python, Flask, API integration, and web development as we worked collaboratively to build this application.

## Features
1. **Soccer-Themed Wordle Gameplay:**
   - Players have 6-8 attempts to guess the correct soccer player.
   - Auto-complete search bar assists in entering valid player names.

2. **Hints System:**
   - Reveal a silhouette of the player for an added challenge.

3. **Player Feedback:**
   - Color-coded indicators guide players towards the correct answer.
   - Feedback includes information such as the player's **team**, **position**, and **stats**.

4. **API Integration:**
   - The app fetches real-time soccer player data, including names, stats, and images, via an external soccer API.

5. **Image Silhouette Generation:**
   - Player images are transformed into silhouettes using Python's **Pillow** library.

6. **Endgame Summary:**
   - At the end of the game, display the player's profile, including their image, name, team, and key stats.
   - Option to play again with a new randomly selected player.

7. **Responsive User Interface:**
   - Built with **Flask** and **Bootstrap** for a clean, modern, and user-friendly experience.
